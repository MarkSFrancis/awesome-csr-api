# Awesome Client Side Rendering + API

Check out the demo:  
https://tanstack-router-poc.pages.dev/

This repo demonstrates what we believe to be the best developer experience available today for React web apps that have a backend for frontend (BFF) API (an API that only exists to serve this particular web app), but do not need server-side rendering (SSR). Such web apps are usually those that require authentication to access any part of the site. Examples can include business to business (B2B) web apps, internal tools, or private data entry web apps (like a fitness tracker).

# Why do we need this?

A large portion of development on the web does not benefit from SSR (such as no need for search engine optimisation (SEO), no need for HTTP streaming, etc). Client-side rendering (CSR) tooling has come on significantly since the inception of [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), but unfortunately the community still has no answer for connecting such a web app to an API, except by treating them as two separate entities.

As such, many developers give up on CSR and end up building with SSR for no reason other than needing an API for their front-end (FE), without wanting the complexity of 2 deployments to manage. This makes hosting much more complex, wastes CPU on unnecessary renders (which, like all unnecessary energy expenditure, impacts the global climate), requires the developer to support rendering on both the server and the client, and generally complicates the developer experience.

This repository sets out to demonstrate that there is a better way. It's time that SSR once again became a tool that you only reach for when you truly need it.

# What this repository offers

## Things you'd expect from a CSR app

- Type-safe routing with autocomplete on any `Link`s
- Hot module reload on local, bundled and minified in production
- Lazy-loading, so if you have extremely complex payloads on certain routes, you can switch to lazy-loading for just those routes
- Static hosting for free, so that if your users don't invoke your API, you'll incur no cost.
- Proper fallback to `/index.html` when no files / routes are found

## Especially for CSR + API

- End-to-end type safety, across the FE and BE. If you rename an API endpoint or change its schema, you'll get instant TS warnings in the front-end. You'll also get autocomplete for the API endpoint's body schema, available API endpoints, etc. You can even use your IDE's "Go to definition" when using an API endpoint from the FE, and it'll navigate to the API endpoint on the BE for you
- You only pay for `/api` requests, and even then, the first 10,000,000 API requests each month are free on the $5 per month Standard plan, or 100,000 each month on the Free plan. [Check out the Cloudflare workers pricing here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers)
- Automatic CI/CD deployments, including automatic preview environments for PRs, which will never expire, at no additional cost
- Authentication by default on all API endpoints. You're probably using CSR to protect non-public data, so authentication is treated as a first-class citizen
- Access to a cloud provider's full resource offerings for advanced scenarios, such as SQL databases, custom queues, key-value stores, and more, with Typescript support for interacting with all those custom resources
- Easy to add custom metrics / insights to (via [Cloudflare's analytics engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#analytics-engine))
- `404` status code responses when trying to invoke API endpoints that don't exist, whilst still serving the standard CSR `index.html` fallback for any non-API route requests

## Things that aren't included here

- Image optimisation
  - We'd recommend checking out the Vite plugin [Vite Image Optimizer](https://github.com/FatehAK/vite-plugin-image-optimizer) for this
- OAuth
  - Check out the docs for your OAuth provider to find out how to add support for it.
  - We've provided a basic auth example which uses static authorization headers. Check out the code in `functions/api/_middleware.ts` (server-side) and `src/api/ApiProvider.tsx` (client-side)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Because `functions/api/_middleware.ts` can enrich the request context, you can add any extra information about the user you'd like (such as what roles they have). [Check out the Cloudflare middleware docs here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/middleware/)
  - The exact implementation will depend on how granular your web app's permissions model is, we've left it as out-of-scope for this repository

# Technologies we use

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [@tanstack/router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages)

## Why Cloudflare?

We believe Cloudflare pages is the best way to host a CSR + API application.

- Simple but effective git integration
- Scale to zero
- Very cheap hosting, with it being easy to set up a proof of concept to show your boss at work for free
- Already a well-respected brand in the enterprise space, where many of the B2B apps that this repository is well-suited for are being created
- Enough cloud offerings to cover most common web application's needs

With that said, if you believe another cloud provider offers a better alternative, we encourage you to build a proof of concept with it and let us know!

### Using NodeJS instead

If "scale to zero" doesn't matter to you, you don't mind losing the ability to have preview environments that last forever, or you just don't want to use Cloudflare, a NodeJS process might be a better fit for you, which you could run on almost any cloud provider you like, or even self-host. This project can be horizontally (multiple instances running in parallel to handle traffic) or vertically scaled (bigger CPU + RAM on your NodeJS instance(s)), so you can use a load balancer and a set of scaling rules to handle virtually any volume of traffic. 

Such a server that runs tRPC for `/api` endpoints and serves static files for the rest gets a great deal of the same benefits as this repository does, but without the need for Cloudflare. If this sounds like a perfect fit for you, you should check out Vite's [middleware mode](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-middlewaremode) and the [tRPC Express adapter](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters/express).

# Running on your local machine

## Prerequisites

- Git
- NodeJS

## Steps

1. Clone the project onto your local machine
1. Open a shell at the root of the project and run `npm i`
1. Run `npx wrangler pages dev`
1. Open another shell at the root of the project and run `npm run dev`
1. Once the dev server is running, whilst that shell is focused, press "o" and "Enter" to open the project in your browser

# Deploying to Cloudflare

1. Push to `main`. That's it!

## Setting up deployment

If you want to deploy from your own repository (or to your own Cloudflare environment):

1. [Sign up for a Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) if you don't have one already
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
   - Cloudflare also supports GitLab as a git provider
1. Follow [the cloudflare guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/) to connect your new repository to your Cloudflare account

# Going beyond 🚀

For going further than the scope of this demo, the complexity will depend on what kind of extensions you want to make.

## Extending the FE

If you want to extend just the UI / FE, you can use all the normal react tooling you're used to. You're free to add any packages, dependencies, etc, as long as they can be bundled and can run in a browser. Have fun!

If you'd like, you can even rip out the FE we have here, and the project will still deploy + operate as expected.
You'll need:

- A `tRPC` client
- Something that emits static build output to `/dist`

Most of CSR tools out there today already support both of these things. For example, you could use NextJS with [a static `export` configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports), though you'll need to override the output directory from `/out` to `/dist`.

## Extending the BE

This application largely has 3 modes:

- Production (the production deployment)
- Preview (deployments used by PR previews)
- Dev (running locally on a dev machine)

When creating / connecting to your own resource(s), you'll need to start by deciding how you want to interact with it in each of these different modes. For example, if you're connecting to an [S3 bucket on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), you might want a dev bucket, a preview bucket, and a production bucket. 

This guide is not going to help you deploy / manage your custom resource(s), but we do recommend that you consider the 3 modes listed above when doing so. Instead, this guide will walk you through how to connect them to this project, and assumes you already know how to deploy / manage your custom resource(s). 

### Adding a Cloudflare resource

If what you need is already covered by Cloudflare's offerrings, that's great! You can just extend the `wranger.toml` file in this project, along with adding the resource to `./api/env.ts`, as per the wranger docs.

You can find a lot of Cloudflare's listed offerings, as well as how to add them to a `Pages` project in the [Bindings docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/).

For example, if you want a SQL database, you could use Cloudflare's [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#d1-databases) offering.

#### Example: Adding a Cloudflare D1 database

1. Start by logging into Cloudflare with `npx wrangler login`
1. Then, add your database with `npx wrangler d1 create prod-d1-tutorial`. Make sure to note down the database's ID
1. Then run it again to create a 2nd DB for preview `npx wrangler d1 create preview-d1-tutorial`
1. Then run it for the 3rd time to create a final DB for dev `npx wrangler d1 create dev-d1-tutorial`
1. Next, add it to the `wrangler.toml` file:

   ```toml
   [env.preview]
   d1_databases = [
     { binding = "DB", database_name = "prod-d1-tutorial", database_id = "<UUID1>" },
   ]

   [env.production]
   d1_databases = [
       { binding = "DB", database_name = "preview-d1-tutorial", database_id = "<UUID2>" },
   ]

   [env.development]
   d1_databases = [
       { binding = "DB", database_name = "dev-d1-tutorial", database_id = "<UUID2>" },
   ]
   ```

1. You'll then need to update the `api/env.ts` file with the new database, like so:

   ```ts
   export interface Env {
     APP_NAME: string;
     DB: D1Database;
   }
   ```

1. Now you can use it in your tRPC endpoints.

   Here's an example imagining a `postsRouter` that interacts with a `"Posts"` table:

   ```ts
   import { procedure, router } from "../trpc";
   import { z } from "zod";

   type Post = {
     id: number;
     title: string;
   };

   export const postsRouter = router({
     create: procedure
       .input(z.object({ title: z.string() }))
       .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
         const ps = ctx.DB.prepare('INSERT INTO "Posts" (title) VALUES (?)');
         await ps.bind(input.title).run();
       }),
     getAll: procedure.query(async (req) => {
       const ps = req.ctx.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM "Posts"');
       const data = await ps.all<Post>();

       return data.results;
     }),
   });
   ```

### Adding a cloudflare integration

A limited number of 3rd parties have Cloudflare integrations. These cloud providers can add support for their offerings via the Cloudflare dashboard. You'll need to follow their documentation to find out the steps for this process. [Check out the Cloudflare docs here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/integrations/).

If you're using a database, you'll probably want a relevant [database driver](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/databases/connecting-to-databases/).

### Interacting with an existing API / service

The simplest way to interact with most APIs is to just use `fetch`.

#### Example: Fetching data from a public API

For example, if you're fetching a list of todos from a 3rd party API, you might write some code like this:

```ts
import { procedure, router } from "../trpc";

export const todosRouter = router({
  getAll: procedure.query(async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos", {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });

    // ⚠️ Don't forget to check for `response.ok` if appropriate
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Something went wrong fetching todos");

    const data: {
      userId: number;
      id: number;
      title: string;
      completed: boolean;
    }[] = await response.json();

    return data;
  }),
});
```

If you want to use an SDK that isn't simply a `fetch` wrapper, you might run into some difficulties due to how Cloudflare doesn't use NodeJS as its runtime. You can find out more about this in [Cloudflare's external services docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/integrations/external-services/)

#### Configuring the environment

For non-secret values, you can just use the environment variables.

##### Accessing from the BE

If you're accessing them from your BE, here's how to set it up:

1. Open `wrangler.toml`
1. Choose a name for your value (such as `OAUTH_URL`)
1. For each of the `env.{mode}.vars` + `vars` sections, add the relevant values for the mode, with the name set to what you decided before

   ```toml
   # Here's an example with OAUTH_URL for each mode
   [vars]
   # ...
   OAUTH_URL = 'https://development.oauth-site.com'

   [env.preview.vars]
   # ...
   OAUTH_URL = 'https://preview.oauth-site.com'

   [env.production.vars]
   # ...
   OAUTH_URL = 'https://production.oauth-site.com'
   ```

   If you have no dedicated values for a mode, you can re-use the values. For example, you might re-use the dev value for both `development` and `preview` modes. This is fine!

   ```toml
   [vars]
   # ...
   OAUTH_URL = 'https://development.oauth-site.com'

   [env.preview.vars]
   # ...
   OAUTH_URL = 'https://development.oauth-site.com'

   [env.production.vars]
   # ...
   OAUTH_URL = 'https://production.oauth-site.com'
   ```

1. Add the new key to your `api/env.ts` file

   ```ts
   export interface Env {
     // ...
     OAUTH_URL: string;
   }
   ```

1. You can now use it in any tRPC endpoint

   ```ts
   import { procedure, router } from "../trpc";
   import { z } from "zod";

   export const oauthRouter = router({
     getUrl: procedure.query(async (req) => {
       return req.ctx.OAUTH_URL;
     }),
   });
   ```

1. If you want to know more, check out the [Cloudflare environment docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#environment-variables)

##### Accessing from the FE

If you're accessing them from your FE, here's how to set it up:

1. Choose a name for your value (such as `OAUTH_URL`)
1. For each of the `env.{mode}` + `.env` files, add the relevant values for the mode, with the name set to `VITE_{what you decided before}`. If you don't prefix the variable with `VITE_`, it won't be included in the bundle

   ```
   # .env
   VITE_OAUTH_URL=https://development.oauth-site.com
   ```

   ```
   # .env.preview
   VITE_OAUTH_URL=https://preview.oauth-site.com
   ```

   ```
   # .env.production
   VITE_OAUTH_URL=https://production.oauth-site.com
   ```

   If you have no dedicated values for a mode, you can re-use the values. For example, you might re-use the dev value for both `development` and `preview` modes. This is fine!

   ```
   # .env
   VITE_OAUTH_URL=https://development.oauth-site.com
   ```

   ```
   # .env.preview
   VITE_OAUTH_URL=https://development.oauth-site.com
   ```

   ```
   # .env.production
   VITE_OAUTH_URL=https://production.oauth-site.com
   ```

1. Add the new key to your `src/vite-env.d.ts` file

   ```ts
   interface ImportMetaEnv {
     // ...
     readonly VITE_OAUTH_URL: string;
   }
   ```
1. You can now access the value anywhere in your FE via `import.meta.env`
   ```tsx
   export const SignIn = () => <a href={import.meta.env.VITE_OAUTH_URL}>Sign in</a>
   ```

1. If you want to know more about this, check out the [Vite mode docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode)

#### Secrets

For secret values that you don't want in source control or Cloudflare logs (such as API keys), you should use [Cloudflare secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/)

### Adding non-cloudflare resource(s)

Because it is outside of Cloudflare, you'll need to set up your own CI/CD scripts to deploy to the relevant provider(s). Unfortunately, you'll have to figure out how to deploy it yourself, as we cannot provide a guide for you on interacting with your own resources.

That said, we do make the following recommendations:

- Consider running a clean up for preview mode deployment's resource(s) when their PRs are merged. This avoids leaving lots of unnecessary infrastructure lying around
- Make sure that preview mode deployments can be made in parallel. It's likely that multiple PRs will exist concurrently, so you'll need to support having multiple preview mode deployments running side-by-side
- Consider the cost of hosting multiple instances, particularly in preview mode. If you can't scale to zero, you might want a much smaller version of your service than the production version (such as less RAM, less CPU, etc.)
- Consider managing your custom resource(s) in a separate repository, with a single deployment each for development, preview, and production mode, particularly if it's not likely to need changes to it to be deployed at the same time as changes to this project
- Consider keeping the variables that Cloudflare will need consistent (e.g. all preview mode deployments use the same variable values). If they're dynamic (they change on every PR deployment), you'll likely need to opt-out of Cloudflare's built-in `git` integration and use [wrangler deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/#deploy-your-assets) instead, so that you can inject any generated values from your resource(s) into the Cloudflare `wrangler.toml` file before the app is deployed to Cloudflare

Once you've got the resource(s) deploying, check out the [integration](#interacting-with-an-existing-api--service) section to integrate this project with it.

### Hosting somewhere else

This project is not currently cloud provider agnostic. If you wish to move away from cloudflare, you might want to consider [using NodeJS instead](#using-nodejs-instead).
